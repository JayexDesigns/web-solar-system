<h1 align="center">Web Solar System (WIP)</h1>
<p align="center">In this simulation you will be able to see what would happen in different scenarios that you can choose in terms of orbits and planets.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>When you enter the webpage that is liked below you will see an arrow on the top of the page, when clicked a menu with two buttons will drop.
<br/><br/>
The first one will allow you to create planets by setting it's name, initial position, initial velocity, mass, radius and color, keep in mind that two planets can't have the same name.
<br/><br/>
The second one will display a list of the current planet names and a cross in case you want to delete them, more options will be added soon.
<br/><br/>
Also if you are trying this on a computer you will be able to click wherever you want to spawn a planet and drag your cursor to set it's initial velocity, a random planet with a random name will appear at the moment you release your click.</p>
